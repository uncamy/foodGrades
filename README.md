Food Grades
==========

<H4>What not to eat: using open NYC data to determine the relationship between restaurant health grades and food poisoning cases. </H4>

This project will use heat map visualizations and descriptive statics to show trends in restaurant health grades in Manhattan. We are exploring multiple visualization techniques and tools including D3, Google Maps API and Python Pandas to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each tool. Once the health grade data is elucidated we will determine the association of restaurant health grades and food poisoning controlling for confounding. 

<strong>Currently available:</strong>
Basic Flask App showing map of Manhattan
Geocoded data set of NYC health grades (by zip)

<strong>Coming soon:</strong>
Comparison of heat map tools 
Analysis of restaurant health data and incident food poisoning cases
